# Introduction to CRAX

CRAX (Create React App Xtended) is a modern, Vite-powered framework designed to streamline the development of Single Page Applications (SPAs) with React. It aims to provide a lightweight, performant, and developer-friendly experience by integrating essential features and best practices out-of-the-box.

## Why CRAX?

In the rapidly evolving landscape of web development, developers often face a choice between highly opinionated, feature-rich frameworks that can feel heavy, and minimalist libraries that require extensive setup. CRAX seeks to strike a balance, offering:

- **Simplicity:** A clear and intuitive API that reduces boilerplate.
- **Performance:** Leveraging Vite for fast development and optimized builds.
- **Built-in Essentials:** Core features like routing, state management, and image optimization are integrated, so you don't have to piece them together.
- **Developer Experience:** Focus on conventions and sensible defaults to make development enjoyable and efficient.

CRAX is built on top of robust and widely adopted technologies, ensuring a solid foundation for your projects.

## Core Principles

- **Convention over Configuration:** Sensible defaults and file-based conventions reduce the need for explicit configuration.
- **Modularity:** While features are integrated, they are designed to be understandable and, where appropriate, extensible.
- **Performance First:** Optimizations are considered at every level, from development speed to production build efficiency.
- **Modern Web Standards:** Embracing the latest web APIs and best practices.

Whether you're building a small personal project or a complex business application, CRAX provides a powerful yet approachable environment for your React SPAs.
